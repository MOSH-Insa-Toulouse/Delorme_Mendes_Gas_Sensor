# KiCad Project

Damaris Mendes Ferreira and Margot Delorme.

### Introduction

In the MOSH (Microcontroller and Open Source Hardware) course we developed a gas sensor shield for an Arduino Uno board. The goal of this project is to construct a PCB that contains a gas sensor, LEDs, a buzzer and a LoRa module. This system should be capable to monitor the level of CO2 in a room and then send this information to a LoRaWAN using The Things Network site. The gas sensor is going to measure the level of CO2 and the Arduino is going to evaluate this level by taking a threshold as comparative. If the quantity of this gas crosses this threshold, a buzzer is activated and a red LED is fired. When the level of gas returns to its normal state, the buzzer is turned off and a green LED is turned on indicating a normal situation.

The followings sections are going to show all the results that we obtained in this project to make the final PCB layout.
